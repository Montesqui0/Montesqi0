##### Hello World!  
I've been learning programming for the past 3 years, although not continuously; I have studied in blocks of a few months. I estimate my actual study time to be around 18 months in total.  
During this time, I have acquired various skills, including C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, game and website development, console programs, Windows Forms, etc. However, I had never explored the world of Git and GitHub.  
For that reason, I am now focusing on learning these skills to become productive in a cooperative IT job in the future.  
Once my knowledge is sufficient, I will refine my projects so others can access them.  

Thanks for read!
